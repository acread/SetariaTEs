**How far are TEs to differentially methylated tiles (DMTs)?**

To answer this I am taking 5 lists of DRM dependent losses \
    1.  CG-loss\
    2.  CHG-loss\
    3.  CHH-loss\
    4.  CHH-loss (includes minimal loss)\
    5.  Very high CHH sites
    
I am finding distance from either:\
    A1.  All Homology TEs (includes DE status)\
    A2.  All Milhouse TEs\
    A3.  All non-Milhouse DSTs

**A1 - All Homology TEs to each of the DRM dep loss tiles**

**A2 - All Milhouse TEs to each of the DRM dep loss tiles**
